# Código de Ray Tracing em Python

**Prompt utilizado para geração do código:**
```plaintext
You are an expert Python programmer with deep knowledge of computer graphics, especially in ray tracing. Your task is to create a fully functional and executable Python script that implements a simple ray tracing scene. The program should:

- Use only Python and standard or widely available libraries such as NumPy and PyOpenGL.
- Render a 3D scene with at least one moving object (e.g., a sphere bouncing up and down).
- Implement basic lighting, including diffuse and specular reflections.
- Display the rendered scene in a window using a graphical library such as Pygame or OpenGL.
- Continuously update the scene to create an animation effect.
- Avoid pseudo-code and ensure the script runs without additional modifications.

The script should be optimized for readability and efficiency, using modular functions where appropriate. Include comments explaining key parts of the code to aid understanding.
